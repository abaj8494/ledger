This repository is my full-stack wrapper around [ledger-cli](https://ledger-cli.org/).

In essence, I wanted to view, query and mutate my ledger file beyond just from within Emacs.

As such I have built a lightweight front-end in Svelte.js and used C++ in the backend to facilitate this functionality.

The [site](https://ledger.abaj.ai) is locked by nginx, but the source code is available here should you be interested in the project and wish to deploy it for your own use.
